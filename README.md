Tip toe, careful what you wish for
You don't wanna end up in my sights, my my
Wishful thinking you might get home
You might have to gamble with your life, oh my

Keep on testing all my patience
There's an open invitation
Got something to say?
Then you better say it
Just know that you reap what you sow

Close my eyes and I see red
All these demons in my head
They beat me blue, they want me dead
I close my eyes and I see red, red
All these demons in my red, red
They want me dead, they want me red, red
I close my eyes and I see red, red
I close my eyes and I see red

Careful who you choose as a target
King of the world, yeah I think I'm on it
I don't think you know what you started
'Cause one of us is ending up in a coffin

Keep on testing all my patience
There's an open invitation
Got something to say?
Then you better say it
Just know that you reap what you sow

Close my eyes and I see red
All these demons in my head
They beat me blue, they want me dead
I close my eyes and I see red, red
All these demons in my red, red
They want me dead, they want me red, red
I close my eyes and I see red, red
I close my eyes and I see red

Strange how quickly you went silent
Wait, now you're saying you're not 'bout it
Don't stop, you should keep on talking
Now talk, let's see if you can walk

Close my eyes and I see red
All these demons in my head
They beat me blue, they want me dead
I close my eyes and I see red, red
All these demons in my red, red
They want me dead, they want me red, red
I close my eyes and I see red, red
I close my eyes and I see red
